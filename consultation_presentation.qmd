## Before the Consultation

- Attended the workshop
- Observed a consultation first
- But real consultations were still unexpected
- First session: solo, a bit chaotic

---

## Client's Question

- Research topic:
  - Conflict & closeness with teacher (T1) → Language performance (T1, T2)
  - Gender as moderator
- Main concern:
  - Missing values in the dataset
  - Inconsistent outputs from SPSS

---

## Mismatch of Expectations

- What I expected:
  - General stats questions
- What the client expected:
  - SPSS walkthrough

> Result: awkward atmosphere when expectations didn’t match

---

## The “NA” Moment

- I used "NA" repeatedly

::: {.incremental}
- She finally asked: *"Sorry… what is NA?"*
- I realized I assumed too much  
- She didn’t feel safe asking earlier
:::

## What I Learned

- Don’t assume prior knowledge
- Say upfront:
  - *"Stop me anytime if something’s unclear"*
- Check in regularly:
  - ✅ *"Was that clear?"*
  - ✅ *"Should I explain that a bit more?"*
- Avoid intimidating phrasing:
  - ❌ *"Do you get it?"*
  - ❌ *"Are you still following?"*

## SPSS: To Help or Not to Help?

- Not supposed to do analyses for clients
- But she was stuck
- Eventually I helped with SPSS
- Still unsure: where’s the boundary?

---

## Session Went Over Time

- Scheduled: 45 min
- Actual: ~90 min
- Client was anxious
- I couldn’t send her away like that


---

## Supervisor Said: Do a t-test?

- No clear explanation why
- Didn't seem meaningful
- Client wanted to "just do it" for her thesis
- What should we do when clients are told to do unclear analyses?
